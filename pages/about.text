# About

My name is Peter Mortimer. I am a PhD candidate at the Bundeswehr University in Munich. In this blog I want to write about obscure roadblocks I have faced in different programming problems in the hopes of being of some use for someone stuck in a similar situation. I'm interested in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Data Visualization.
