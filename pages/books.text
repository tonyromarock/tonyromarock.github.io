# Books I've read

I really got into reading when I started going to university. Here is a simple list of some of my favorite books and I'll add some comments to some of them. This list is inspired by the [book list](http://jsomers.net/#books) of the writer and programmer James Somers. The books do not have a particular order and are only loosely organized by theme and genre.

### Early Nonfiction

- **The New Kings of Nonfiction** introduced by Ira Glass - This collection of different nonfiction articles and book excerpts got me really into nonfiction. Most books I have read in the first few years in university were mostly from the great authors presented in this book. I initially bought this book, because I am a big fan of Ira Glass' podcast _This American Life_.
